/* A stack stores multiple elements in a specific order, called LIFO.

LIFO stands for Last in, First Out. To vizualise LIFO, think of a pile of pancakes, 
where pancakes are both added and removed from the top. So when removing a pancake, 
it will always be the last one you added. This way of organizing elements is called 
LIFO in computer science and programming.

Unlike vectors, elements in the stack are not accessed by index numbers. Since 
elements are added and removed from the top, you can only access the element 
at the top of the stack.

Note: The type of the stack (string in our example) cannot be changed after its been declared.

Note: You cannot add elements to the stack at the time of declaration, like you can with vectors:
*/

//   C++ SET
/*
A set stores unique elements where they:

Are sorted automatically in ascending order.
Are unique, meaning equal or duplicate values are ignored.
Can be added or removed, but the value of an existing element cannot be changed.
Cannot be accessed by index numbers, because the order is based on sorting and not indexing.
To use a set, you have to include the <set> header file:
*/

// Create a set called cars that will store strings
set<string> vehicles;

vehicles.insert("Tesla");
vehicles.insert("VW");
vehicles.insert("Mitsubishi");

// Remove Vector Elements
vehicles.erase("Audi");



// Print set elements
for (string vehicle : vehicles) {
  cout << vehicle << "\n\n";
}





//      C++ Map
/* 
A map stores elements in "key/value" pairs.

Elements in a map are:

Accessible by keys (not index), and each key is unique.
Automatically sorted in ascending order by their keys.
To use a map, you have to include the <map> header file:
*/

//Create a MAP
// Create a map called people that will store strings as keys and integers as values
map<string, int> people;

// Create a map that will store the name and age of different people
//map<string, int> people = { {"John", 32}, {"Adele", 45}, {"Bo", 29} };

// Add new elements
people["Jenny"] = 22;
people["Liam"] = 24;
people["Kasper"] = 20;
people["Anja"] = 30;
people["John"] = 32;
people["Adele"] = 40;
people.insert({"Adele", 45});
people.insert({"Bosah", 29});

//  Access Elements
// Get the value associated with the key "Adele"
cout << "Bosah is: " << people.at("Bosah") << "\n";

//  Change Values of Elements
people.at("John") = 50;

// Remove an element by key
people.erase("Jenny");

// Remove all elements
// people.clear();

//  Find Size of A Map
cout << people.size() << "\n";

//  Check if MAP is Empty
cout << people.empty() << "\n";

/*  Loop Through A MAP

You can loop through a map with the for-each loop. However, 
there are a couple of things to be aware of:

You should use the auto keyword (introduced in C++ version 11) 
inside the for loop. This allows the compiler to automatically 
determine the correct data type for each key-value pair.
Since map elements consist of both keys and values, you have to
include .first to access the keys, and .second to access values 
in the loop.
Elements in the map are sorted automatically in ascending order by their keys:
*/

for (auto person : people) {
  cout << person.first << " is: " << person.second << "\n";
}



//  C++ Iterators

/* Iterators are used to access and iterate through elements of data structures 
(vectors, sets, etc.), by "pointing" to them.
It is called an "iterator" because "iterating" is the technical term for looping.
To iterate through a vector, look at the following example:
*/

/*
// Create a vector iterator called it
vector<string>::iterator it;

// Loop through the vector with the iterator
for (it = cars.begin(); it != cars.end(); ++it) {
  cout << "\n";
  cout << *it << "\n";
}

// Point to the first element in the vector
it = cars.begin();
cout << *it << "\n";

// Point to the second element
it = cars.begin() + 1;
cout << *it << "\n";

// Point to the last element
it = cars.end() - 1;
cout << *it << "\n\n\n";
*/


/*
  The auto Keyword

In C++ 11 and later versions, you can use the auto keyword instead 
of explicitly declaring and specifying the type of the iterator.

The auto keyword allows the compiler to automatically determine the 
correct data type, which simplifies the code and makes it more readable:

Instead of this:
vector<string>::iterator it = cars.begin();
*/

//  You can simply write this:
auto it = cars.begin();

// Print the first element in the vector
cout << *it << "\n\n";

// Loop through the vector with the iterator
for (auto it = cars.begin(); it != cars.end(); ++it) {
  cout << *it << "\n";
}
  



//    For-Each Loop vs Iterators

/* You can use a for-each loop to just loop through elements of a data structure, like this:

Example
// Create a vector called cars that will store strings.....vector<string> cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
*/
// Print vector elements
for (string car : cars) {
  cout << car << "\n\n\n";
}
/*  When you are just reading the elements, and don't need to modify them, 
the for-each loop is much simpler and cleaner than iterators.

However, when you need to add, modify, or remove elements during iteration, 
iterate in reverse, or skip elements, you should use iterators:
*/

// Loop through vector elements
for (auto it = cars.begin(); it != cars.end(); ) {
  if (*it == "BMW") {
    it = cars.erase(it); // Remove the BMW element
  } else {
    ++it;
  }
}

// Print vector elements
for (const string& car : cars) {
  cout << car << "\n";
}

//  Iterate in Reverse Order
for (auto it = cars.rbegin(); it != cars.rend(); ++it) {
  cout << *it << "\n\n\n";
}


/*
Iterate Through other Data Structures

Iterators are great for code reusability since you can use the same 
syntax for iterating through vectors, lists, deques, sets and maps:

List Example
// Create a list called cars that will store strings
list<string> cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};

// Loop through the list with an iterator
for (auto it = cars.begin(); it != cars.end(); ++it) {
  cout << *it << "\n";
}
Deque Example
// Create a deque called cars that will store strings
deque<string> cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};

// Loop through the deque with an iterator
for (auto it = cars.begin(); it != cars.end(); ++it) {
  cout << *it << "\n";
}
Set Example
// Create a set called cars that will store strings
set<string> cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};

// Loop through the set with an iterator
for (auto it = cars.begin(); it != cars.end(); ++it) {
  cout << *it << "\n";
}
Map Example
// Create a map that will store strings and integers
map<string, int> people = { {"John", 32}, {"Adele", 45}, {"Bo", 29} };

// Loop through the map with an iterator
for (auto it = people.begin(); it != people.end(); ++it) {
  cout << it->first << " is: " << it->second << "\n";
}


NB  The examples above shows how to iterate through different data structures 
that support iterators (vector, list, deque, map and set support iterators, 
while stacks and queues do not).
*/






//    Algorithms
/*
Another important feature of iterators is that they are used with different 
algorithm functions, such as sort() and find() (found in the <algorithm> library), 
to sort and search for elements in a data structure.

For example, the sort() function takes iterators (typically returned by begin() and end()) 
as parameters to sort elements in a data structure from the beginning to the end.
In this example, the elements are sorted alphabetically since they are strings:
*/

// SORT VECTOR ELEMENTS (CARS) IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER
sort(cars.begin(), cars.end());

// Print cars in alphabetical order
for (string car : cars) {
    cout << car << "\n";
  }


// Create a vector called numbers that will store integers
vector<int> numbers = {1, 7, 3, 5, 9, 2};

/*// SORT NUMBERS NUMERICALLY
sort(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());

// Print numbers in ascending order
for (int number : numbers) {
    cout << number << "\n\n";
  }*/

/*//   SORT NUMBERS NUMERICALLY IN REVERSE ORDER
sort(numbers.rbegin(), numbers.rend());

// Print numbers in descending order
for (int number : numbers) {
    cout << number << "\n";
  }*/

//  SORT NUMBERS NUMERICALLY, STARTING FROM THE FOURTH ELEMENT (only sort 5, 9, and 2)
  sort(numbers.begin() + 3, numbers.end());

  // Print numbers
  for (int num : numbers) {
    cout << num << "\n\n";
  }






//    Searching Algorithms

/*  To search for specific elements in a vector, you can use the find() function.
It takes three parameters: start_iterator, end_iterator, value, where value is the
value to search for:*/

// Create a vector called numbers that will store integers
vector<int> numbs = {1, 7, 3, 5, 9, 2};

/*// SERACH FOR THE NUMBER 3
  auto findAlgo = find(numbs.begin(), numbs.end(), 3);

  // Check if the number 3 was found
  if (findAlgo != numbs.end()) {

//To copy elements from one vector to another, you can use the copy() function:

// Create a vector called copiedNumbers that should store 6 integers
vector<int> copiedNumbers(6);
  
// Copy elements from numbers to copiedNumbers
copy(numbs.begin(), numbs.end(), copiedNumbers.begin()); 

// Print elements of copiedNumbers
